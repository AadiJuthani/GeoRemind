# GeoRemind  
An intelligent, location-aware task manager that reminds you to complete tasks exactly when you‚Äôre in the right place.  
**Built as our HackGT 12 project using Flutter + Firebase.**

---

## Inspiration  
As students on a massive campus like Georgia Tech, we constantly found ourselves saying, *‚ÄúOh, I was just at the Student Center, I completely forgot to pick up my package!‚Äù* The mental load of remembering location-specific tasks is real. Forgetting to grab a book from the library or return an Amazon package while walking right past the pickup spot is frustrating and inefficient.  

We wanted to build an app that **does the remembering for you**‚Äîletting your **location trigger your to-do list**.

---

## What It Does  
GeoRemind helps users tie tasks to locations:  

- Create a reminder like **‚ÄúPick up Amazon package‚Äù** and attach it to the **John Lewis Student Center**.  
- Our app continuously and efficiently monitors your location in the background.  
- The moment you enter a **100-meter radius**, a notification instantly pops up reminding you to grab your package.  
- Proof-of-concept: **Automatic Gmail scanning** to detect package delivery emails and create reminders for you.

  <img src="TaskView.png" width="30%"/>
</div>

**Quick walkthrough:**  
Open the app ‚Üí Login using Google or Email ‚Üí Add a task using AI (NLP) or manual input ‚Üí See your tasks pinned on the map ‚Üí Get notified when you‚Äôre near the location.

## Features  
- Location-based reminders that trigger at the right place  
- Gmail integration (prototype) for automatic package reminder creation  
- Live GPS tracking with efficient background geofencing  
- Smart cooldown logic to prevent notification spam  
- Firebase-powered user authentication and cross-device reminder sync  
- Cross-platform support for **iOS, Android, and Web**  

---

## How We Built It  
- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart) for a single codebase across iOS, Android, and Web  
- **Backend & Database:** Firebase Firestore (real-time NoSQL database) + Firebase Authentication  
- **APIs & Services:** Google Maps Platform for maps & location search, Gmail API for email scanning  
- **Core Logic:** `geolocator` package for GPS tracking, `flutter_local_notifications` for OS-level alerts  
- **Collaboration:** Git & GitHub, managed within VS Code  

---

## Challenges We Ran Into  
- Debugging native build issues (CocoaPods, iOS permissions, Info.plist, Xcode quirks)  
- Managing efficient background location tracking without draining battery  
- Navigating Gmail API OAuth 2.0 authentication under hackathon time pressure  
- Balancing scope vs. feasibility‚Äîwe pivoted to a simulated email scan for a smooth demo  

---

## Accomplishments We‚Äôre Proud Of  
- Shipped a **full-stack, cross-platform mobile app in just 36 hours**  
- Implemented an efficient continuous location listener with geofence triggers  
- Built cooldown logic to keep notifications useful instead of overwhelming  
- Collaborated effectively under 36-hour time pressure and delivered a polished demo  

---

## What We Learned  
- End-to-end mobile app development: from native setup to deployment  
- Prioritization under deadlines‚Äîfocusing on features that would wow in a demo  
- Debugging and integrating complex APIs (Maps, Gmail, Firebase)  
- The value of collaboration, version control, and quick pivots
